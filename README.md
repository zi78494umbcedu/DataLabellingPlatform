# DataLabellingPlatform
Data Labelling Platform(Make the best models with the best data - https://scale.com/)

Full Stack + Web3 Project
(S3 + Nextjs + Solana + web3.js)

Usecases:
1. Human labelled data for the machine's learning
2. Highest click through rate(e.g., broadcasting for surveys)
Thus web3 accommodating smaller tasks across via iterational micro-payments

Similar to:- Mechanical Turks. A crowdsourcing marketplace since many things that humans can still do much more effectively, example, modering content, performing data deduplication, or research (basically, divide and conquer)
Major usecase of MTurks, leveraging consumer insights dependent F&B industry, thus uncovering important market trends.
